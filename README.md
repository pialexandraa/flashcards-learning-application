Title: Flashcards learning application

Short description: Under the hood, the app features mainly a HashMap demonstrative implementation, with a linkedlist based on the extensive class of Node.

Long description: The game/application is desgined to touch on the following points:

1. have a clean implementation where each component is smoothly integrated into the ensemble;
2. the actual data defintion that the hashmap and application work with/operate on is a dictionary; alternatively the data could be served from a lightweight database;
3. compared to other games/apps that I have wrote, the error handling is not so strong here, yet the minimum is basically implemented (like, for example the user input);
4. The flashcards are displayed in a loop. The user can stop the game with a simple 'Ctrl + C' via the 'KeyboardInterrupt' exception. I hid the exception upon the game termination;
